	    <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br/>
           Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br/>
           While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br/>
           As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br/>
           “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Only this and nothing more.”<br/>
		</p>

		<p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br/>
           And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br/>
           Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br/>
           From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br/>
           For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Nameless here for evermore.<br/>
		</p>
		<p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br/>
           Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br/>
           So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br/>
           “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br/>
           Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This it is and nothing more.”<br/>
		</p>
		<p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br/>
           “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br/>
           But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br/>
           And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br/>
           That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Darkness there and nothing more.<br/>
		</p>
		<p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br/>
           Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br/>
           But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br/>
           And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”<br/>
           This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Merely this and nothing more.
		</p>
		<p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br/>
           Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br/>
           “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;<br/>
           Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—<br/>
           Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”<br/>
		</p>
		<p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br/>
           In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;<br/>
           Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br/>
           But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—<br/>
           Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br/>
		</p>
		<p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br/>
           By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br/>
           “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,<br/>
           Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—<br/>
           Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br/>
		</p>
		<img src="images/jeffRaven3Inverted.png"  />
		<p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br/>
           Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;<br/>
           For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br/>
           Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—<br/>
           Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp With such name as “Nevermore.”<br/>
		</p>
		<p>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br/>
           That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br/>
           Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—<br/>
           Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—<br/>
           On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Then the bird said “Nevermore.”<br/>
		</p>
		<p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br/>
           “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store<br/>
           Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br/>
           Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—<br/>
           Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”<br/>
		</p>
		<p>But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,<br/>
           Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br/>
           Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br/>
           Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—<br/>
           What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”<br/>
		</p>
		<p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br/>
           To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;<br/>
           This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br/>
           On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,<br/>
           But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br/>
		</p>
		<p>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br/>
           Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br/>
           “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee<br/>
           Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;<br/>
           Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br/>
		</p>
		<p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—<br/>
           Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br/>
           Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—<br/>
           On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—<br/>
           Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.<br/>
		</p>
		<img src="images/jeffRaven2Inverted.png"  />
		<p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!<br/>
           By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—<br/>
           Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br/>
           It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br/>
           Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br/>
		</p>
		<p>“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—<br/>
           “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!<br/>
           Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br/>
           Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!<br/>
           Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br/>
		</p>
		
		<p>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br/>
           On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br/>
           And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,<br/>
           And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br/>
           And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br/>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Shall be lifted—nevermore!<br/>
